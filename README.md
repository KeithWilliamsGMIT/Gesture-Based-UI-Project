# Gesture Based UI Project
### By Keith Williams and Mindaugas Vainauskas
This is a fourth year team project for our Gesture Based UI module in college. For this project we were required to develop a gesture controlled application. We decided to create a 3D, two player, table tennis game using the Kinect V2 and unity. This README only outlines how to get started with this project. For full details on the project visit the [wiki](https://github.com/KeithWilliamsGMIT/Gesture-Based-UI-Project/wiki).

### Getting Started
To get started first clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/KeithWilliamsGMIT/Gesture-Based-UI-Project.git
```

Install Unity 5 and open the main menu scene file from the `Gesture-Based-UI-Project/Assets/_Scenes` folder. Unity can be downloaded [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). Connect the Kinect and ensure it is working. This can be done using Kinect Studio. Press the play button in Unity to start the application.
